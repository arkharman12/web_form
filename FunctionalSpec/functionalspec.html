		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p><strong>Singh Cloud</strong> is a freelancing business where independent professionals and businesses can connect and
        collaborate. We are here to help you find the perfect freelancer and jobs in variety of fields with emphasis 
        on web, mobile and software development, IT and Networking, Data Science & Analytics, Engineering & Architecture,
        Design & Creative, Sales & Marketing and Accounting and Consulting. A streamlined and user friendly website is necessary 
        to give the business an edge when competing with other local freelancing businesses.</p>
		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<p>The website needs to have a two-way appearance "I want to work" and "I want to hire" that will make it easy for freelancers and clients 
        to submit information about their needs. Both the freelancer and clients will need to enter their 
        personal contact information, like their name, e-mail, phone number and address. The website will also need to 
        collect freelancing specific questions, what is the main service they offer to clients, a brief description of their skills, 
        experience level and a professional title. On the other hand, clients need to answer questions like, 
        name of their project, brief description of the project, what skills are required, how do they want to pay and what is their
        budget.</p>
		<h2>Primary Audience</h2>
		<p>This website is for any type of freelancer who is looking for work and  for clients who are looking to hire hard-working and
        talented freelancers for their projects. Both will submit, to the best of their ability, information about the need requesting a quote.</p>
		<h2>Secondary Audience</h2>
		<p>While freelancers and clients are our core customers, <strong>Singh Cloud</strong> also services local businesses.</p>
